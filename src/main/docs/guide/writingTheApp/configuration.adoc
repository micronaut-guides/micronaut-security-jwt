Create the a new `application.yml` configuration file:

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=security]
----
<1> Set `authentication` to `bearer` to receive a JSON response from the login endpoint.
<2> You can create a http://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignatureConfiguration.html[SecretSignatureConfiguration] named `generator` via configuration as illustrated above. The `generator` signature is used to sign the issued JWT claims.
<3> Change this to your own secret and keep it safe (do not store this in your VCS).
