Create the a new `application.yml` configuration file:

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----
<1> Enable Micronaut's security capabilities
<2> Expose `/login` endpoint
<3> Expose `/oauth/access_token` endpoint as defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6[section 6 of the OAuth 2.0 spec] - Refreshing an Access Token.
<4> Enable JWT based authentication
<5> You can create a http://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignatureConfiguration.html[SecretSignatureConfiguration] named `generator` via configuration as illustrated above. The `generator` signature is used to sign the issued JWT claims.
<6> Change this by your own secret and keep it safe (do not store this in your VCS)
