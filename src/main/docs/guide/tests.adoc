<1> The AutoCleanup extension makes sure the `close()` method of an object (e.g. `EmbeddedServer`) is called each time a feature method is finished
<2> To run the application from a unit test you can use the http://docs.micronaut.io/api/io/micronaut/runtime/server/EmbeddedServer.html[EmbeddedServer] interface
<3> Register a `RxClient` bean in the application context and point it to the embedded server URL. The `EmbeddedServer` interface provides the URL of the server under test which runs on a random port.
<4> Once you turn on security, every endpoint is secured by default.
<5> To login, do a POST request to `/login` with your credentials as a JSON payload in the body of the request.
<6> Micronaut makes it easy to parse JSON into Java objects.
<7> Micronaut supports https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750[RFC 6750 Bearer Token] specification out-of-the-box. We supply the JWT token in the `Authorization` HTTP Header.
<8> Use .body() to retrieve the parsed payload.
