== Create an App with the Command Line Interface

Create an app using the http://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/guide/index.html#cli[Micronaut Command Line Interface].

`mn create-app example.micronaut.complete --test=spock`

The previous command creates a micronaut app with the default package `example.micronaut` in a folder named `complete`.

By default, `create-app` creates a Java Micronaut app that uses the http://gradle.org[Gradle] build system. However, you could use
other build tools such as `Maven` or other programming languages such as `Groovy` or `Kotlin`.

== Create an App with Micronaut Launch

You can create the app using https://micronaut.com/launch[Micronaut Launch]
